1st you should be respectful to your seniors... and if you have any plan of leaving early you need to make it aware, people will not assume on your behalf, 
2. you have all the options at your disposal, please use them sensibly and I am ready fully cooperate but please understand I am in a lot of stress due to unstable 
team
so I advice you to please talk to Noshir and he shall give you process and other stuff
 
[?8/?28/?2018 11:29 AM]  Rana, Rupali:  
I'm sorry but no one is ready to consider my situatipn either.. that is stressful for me to
Yes I will talk to him
 
[?8/?28/?2018 11:31 AM]  Fulzele, Rahul:  
you need to understand that all everyone is responsible for their actions, I have interviewed 7 people and spent my days to fill your position
now that you are leaving it is the thing i will have to repeat
but do I expect you to understand this? no 
 
[?8/?28/?2018 11:32 AM]  Fulzele, Rahul:  
I do not, I know you are in a family situation, however I am also responsibile for the team and deliverables, we are talking real jobs here.
livelyhood is depend on it,
